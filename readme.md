# Purpose
Currently, this set of scripts supports creating Azure Virtual Machines, installing commonly used development services and frameworks, and running builds.


# Scenarios

##Ionic
Folder *Boxstarter-Ionic* contains scripts using [Boxstarter](http://boxstarter.org/) to provision Azure VMs.

For a scripted walk-through provisioning an Azure VM capable of running Ionic builds, use [guided-install.ps1](Boxstarter-Ionic/guided-install.ps1).
Still, read about preconditions found in [documentation on this topic](Boxstarter-Ionic/boxstarter-ionic.md)
